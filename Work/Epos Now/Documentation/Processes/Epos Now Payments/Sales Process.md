**Epos Now Payments** can be sold via an **Opportunity** like any other product available under either the Subscriptions tab. When the product is added to the basket for the first time a specific rate must be selected (e.g. 0-3%, 3-4%, 5+%). There are different rates available for difference regions. **Epos Now Payments** are sold via subscription bundle products with different options for the various rate ranges. If a rate range has been previously specified then the existing rate will automatically be applied. 

The rate is stored in the **Rate__c** field on the **Opportunity Product** (*OpportunityLineItem*) object as well as listed shown in the name. If a rate has previously been entered on an existing product or subscription with the same **Product Tag** (*Product2.Product_Tag__c*), then the existing rate is automatically populated and cannot be changed.
