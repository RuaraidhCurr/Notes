Salesforce is based around the structured sales process. We get details of potential customers from carious different lead sources which are added to Salesforce as **Leads**. These leads are handled by the *local* sales team and are also added to **Dialler Lists** for automatic contact attempts. 
Once a customer is interested in purchasing from Epos Now the Lead is converted to an **Opportunity** and an **Account** with a **Contact**. An account represents the customer's company and contacts hold the individual customers details. 

A visualization of this process is below.
