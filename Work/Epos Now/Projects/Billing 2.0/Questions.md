- Where do I pull the plans from I.E the counter tops handhelds or should these just be hard coded? 
- Where do I pull the Products attached to this plan? is there a field in Product that links it to a plan and if so what is that field so that I can match it with the users selection from the "Select Plan Category" section

If data is not going to be pulled from classes then this might be a useful link to store data in a external JS file https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-tree-grid/example
