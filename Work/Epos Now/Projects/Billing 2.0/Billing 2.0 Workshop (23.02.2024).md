Checkout 
- refactor the code so that it does the recalculations in the background 
- Move the delivery charge calculation to the basket checkout button rather than on the plan selection process?  
- Basket scrollable with a fixed height
- On the confirm details screen include the billing and shipping details pre-populated if possible
- Have the plan & addon selection process on the account page? (make it load a pre-existing opp or create a new one if one isn't already linked)
- Create a new plan object. Used to rollup subs. Primary sub linked to the plan ? 
- Plan record that contains every sub under that plan, and is the rollup summary of the said subs (by default the min plan with always be one location 1 device, If I buy another device)

## Plans
- Salesforce account can only have one active plan, it will be used to roll up all
