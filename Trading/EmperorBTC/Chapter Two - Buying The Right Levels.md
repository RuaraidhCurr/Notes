We'll be discussing the dynamic landscape of market movements, understanding the significance of support and resistance levels and mastering the art of trading from level to level. We'll also be exploring the more advanced territories like [[Chapter one - BulletProof Your Trading#Deviation|deviation]]/false breakdown and reclaim. 

# How do markets Move?
In crypto, the movement of markets is primarily driven by supply and demand. The prices are determined by the interaction between buyers and sellers. 
**Key factors that influence market movements in Crypto**
1. **Supply and Demand:** When there are higher demand for a specific financial indicator than its available supply, the price tends to rise. Conversely, if there is more supply than demand, the price may decline. 
2. **News and Events:** News related to cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, regulations, partnerships, or significant events can affect market sentiment and subsequently impact prices. 
3. **Market Sentiment:** Sentiment plays a crucial role in crypto markets. If traders have positive expectations about the future of a coin or overall market then they might be inclined to buy and hold, driving prices up. Conversely, negative sentiment can lead to selling and prices declines.  
4. **Technological Developments:** Advancements in blockchain technology, new features or upgrades to existing cryptocurrencies, and the intro of innovative projects can generate interest and impact market movements. 
5. **Market Manipulation:** Like other markets, Crypto can be susceptible to manipulation. e.g. pump and dump schemes cause inflated prices and distortion in the market. 
# What is [[Chapter one - BulletProof Your Trading#Support|Support]] and [[Chapter one - BulletProof Your Trading#Resistance|Resistance]] (S/R)
Support and resistance are two of the most important concepts in trading that help us understand how the price of an asset moves. 

**Support** is like a price level where demand for a cryptocurrency is strong and where many traders want to buy because they believe its a good value point. The rush of buyers at this level l creates an upward force and tried to prevent the price from going down further. 

**Resistance** on the other hand is like a price level where the supply of the coin is high. It's a point where many people want to sell and cause a challenge for the price to move higher. A resistance level is where an uptrend is expected to pause, slow down or reverse due to concentration of supply (sellers).

**NOTE:** Support and Resistance can interchange roles. 

Traders use support and resistance levels to make decisions. When a rice approaches support level, some traders see it as a sign to buy, because they expect it to go up in price from there. Conversely when a price reaches resistance, traders might consider selling because they anticipate that others will also, putting downward pressure on the price. 

Support and resistance levels are not always exact and can be broken. Market conditions change and prices can surprise us. 
## What levels can normally be support or resistance? 
**Option Expiries and Support/Resistance Levels**
	Option expiries can influence the underlying asset price and create temporary support and resistance levels. 
	When a significant number of option contracts are set to expire at a certain price level, it can act as a magnet for the price of the underlying asset. This is because traders may have an incentive to steer the price towards these levels to minimise their losses or maximise their gains.
	**For Example:** If a large number of call (buy) options are set to expire at a certain price level, the sellers (writers) of these options may try to keep the price below this level to avoid having the options exercised. This price level can act as a temporary resistance level. **Conversely**, if a large number of put options set to expire at a certain level, the sellers of these options may try to keep the price above this level to avoid having the options exercised. This price level can act as a temporary support level. 
	
**Area Where Excessive Buying/Selling took place**
	Support and Resistance exist at areas because of extra interest at these levels for auction. 
	Traders perceive these levels to be an interesting level to enter or exit the market. There's no need to worry about using an x ray to look at these levels because price behaviour is enough at most times. 

The below charts help to identify potential support and resistance levels. A price level with a large number of buy orders can act as a support level, as it represents strong demand for the asset. Conversely a price level with a large number of sell orders can act as a resistance level as it represents strong supply for the asset. You can see market selling and market buying taking place in higher quantities at these levels.

**Accumulation of buy orders at a specific level**
The above shows an area of stacked buy orders. This can be an area of support.

![[Pasted image 20230903105746.png|500]]
**Accumulation of unfulfilled sell orders at a given price**
The above shows and area of stacked sell orders. This can be an area of resistance.

However, it is important to note that these support and resistance levels can be very transient, as the order flow can change rapidly in response to changing market conditions. Also, large orders can sometimes be placed to mislead other traders, a practice known as "spoofing".![[Pasted image 20230903110254.png|500]]

If a large number of buyers/sellers entered a position at certain levels, these levels can then act as support/resistance. This is because traders will defend their entry to stay in profit. 

In conclusion, both option expires and order flow charts can provide information about potential support and resistance levels. however they should be used in conjunction with other indicators.  
# what are levels and which ones are important?
In this section, we will introduce systematic approach to analysing charts by identifying levels. By mastering this skill, you should be able to confidently mark levels on different charts, removing uncertainty. Trading level by level is the key to overcoming fear and maximising profits.
## The Object Tree Option In TradingView (TV)
**This is not necessary for trading but it is a tool to conveniently organise your levels and tools**

The object tree is a TV feature that allows you to manage and organise various objects and indicators. The object tree allows you to access and control different elements such as trendlines, support & resistance levels drawings, indicators, and other graphical objects, grouping specific indicators into specific groups, E.G Daily, Weekly, Monthly. 
## Levels on Monthly chart
Monthly charts help us understand the bigger picture. 
**We will focus on closing and opening prices as key levels. These are important levels based on time and might not necessarily be [[Chapter one - BulletProof Your Trading#Support|S]]/[[Chapter one - BulletProof Your Trading#Resistance|R]]**.

**Monthly resistance**
	The monthly linear chart helps us gauge the magnitude of the price movement and determine whether any pullbacks are within the normal range, given the overall upward trend.![[Pasted image 20230903115811.png|600]]
	The better understand how to plot the monthly levels, lets take a look at the previous cycle in the chart below. 
	The previous all-time high (ATH) closing price is marked. 
	Notice how 1 year later there was a re-test at the same level, followed by a breakout. Levels often get retested frequently, returning to a point where buyers previously couldn't enter. Note that after the breakout of this level at the end of 2020, the next candle crossed below the level to claim liquidity.![[Pasted image 20230903120249.png|600]] 
	Observe the similar movement that occurred after the breakout candle went below the breakout level to claim liquidity.
**Important**
	1. Take note of the significant price surge from the previous all-time high (ATH). Understand that any pullback, no matter how large, is a natural part of market dynamics and not necessarily a result of manipulation or dumping. Don't assume that a pullback indicates the end of an asset or asset class. The monthly linear levels will help you anticipate various types of movements. 
	2. Label your lines clearly to avoid confusion and maintain a clear understanding of each level. You can do this by right clicking non the link and selecting "Text" to add labels.![[Pasted image 20230903121001.png|600]]

## The Monthly chart
![[Pasted image 20230903121232.png]]
The monthly chart provides important levels that are crucial for trading strategy and staying vigilant in managing market movements. 

**Identify the following levels:**
	- ATM level (All-Time High)
	- Previous ATH (All-Time High)
	- Yearly open for the current year
	- Current Monthly range
	- ATH Monthly resistance

Regarding the chart above:
The first level represents a re-test in the previous cycle.
Notice how we returned to re-test the yearly open at number 2.
During a market downturn, it can be beneficial to place small orders at these levels and anticipate increased demand when re-testing the yearly open. 
When trading closely monitor these levels at a macro level. If Bitcoin reaches any of these levels, it should not be a cause for fear or surprise. The purpose of recognizing these levels is to be prepared to make trading decisions when they occur. 
## Levels on Weekly chart
In the chart below you will see weekly levels, it's important to observe how they differ from monthly levels. To emphasise, when refering to levels we
