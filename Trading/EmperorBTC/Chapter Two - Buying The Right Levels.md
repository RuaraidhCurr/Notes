# How do markets Move?
In crypto, the movement of markets is primarily driven by supply and demand. The prices are determined by the interaction between buyers and sellers. 
**Key factors that influence market movements in Crypto**
1. **Supply and Demand:** When there are higher demand for a specific financial indicator than its available supply, the price tends to rise. Conversely, if there is more supply than demand, the price may decline. 
2. **News and Events:** News related to cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, regulations, partnerships, or significant events can affect market sentiment and subsequently impact prices. 
3. **Market Sentiment:** Sentiment plays a crucial role in crypto markets. If traders have positive expectations about the future of a coin or overall market then they might be inclined to buy and hold, driving prices up. Conversely, negative sentiment can lead to selling and prices declines.  
4. **Technological Developments:** Advancements in blockchain technology, new features or upgrades to existing cryptocurrencies, and the intro of innovative projects can generate interest and impact market movements. 
5. **Market Manipulation:** Like other markets, Crypto can be susceptible to manipulation. e.g. pump and dump schemes cause inflated prices and distortion in the market. 
# What is [[Chapter one - BulletProof Your Trading#Support|Support]] and [[Chapter one - BulletProof Your Trading#Resistance|Resistance]] (S/R)
Support and resistance are two of the most important concepts in trading that help us understand how the price of an asset moves. 
**Support** is like a price level where demand for a cryptocurrency is strong and where many traders want to buy because they believe its a good value point. The rush of buyers at this level l creates an upward force and tried to prevent the price from going down further. 
**Resistance** on the other hand is like a price level where the supply of the coin is high. It's a point where many people want to sell and cause a challenge for the price to move higher. A resistance level is where an uptrend is expected to pause, slow down or reverse due to concentration of supply (sellers).
