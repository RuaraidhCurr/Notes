# Introduction

## The Study of Charts
studying charts can be done logically, it provides you statistics about the price. Price is derived automatically by the market after considering all the fundamental news, fear & optimism of the market, so the study of charts is the study of trend & strength of the assets.

**The only reason trading with charts works is because historical events replicate themselves and rhyme.** *Patterns that worked well in the past are assumed to continue to work well in the future, 'The study of human psychology which tends not to change'* **Patterns repeat, behaviour repeats**

e.g. If there is a lot of market selling in the support range and it is all being absorbed by the limit orders than we can assume that whales are accumulating there. 

All trading is taking historical data (be it candlesticks patters on a chart or a repeat of similar kind of macroeconomic conditions or new fundamentals or a trend shown pricing). Trading is taking historical data and trying to find correlations where history might rhyme with present conditions. 

This is an introduction tutorial to how markets move and function and how at first you should manage risk and take trades. 

There are two types of trading:
### [[Discretionary Trading]]
Discretionary trading relies on the traders judgement for making all trading decisions. They ultimately make their decisions based on their experience, analysis, intuition & judgement on the market. 
	**For Example:** a discretionary trader might come in at the start of the day with a plan to trade a particular stock if it drops to a certain price. However, if news comes out during the day that changes the trader's outlook on the stock, they might decide not to buy it after all, or perhaps buy more of it than originally planned. 
### [[Systematic Trading]]
Systematic trading refers to a method where decisions are made based on a pre-set system or algorithm. This is developed using quantitative research and statistical analysis. Once a system is developed trades are executed automatically. based on rules set for the system.
	**For Example:** A trading system might be to buy a particular stock when its 50-day moving average crosses above its 200-day moving average, and sell when the opposite happens.

# Candlesticks
Candles are used instead of line charts because a line char cannot tell the high, low, open and close at a given period. Candles give you queues about the strength of a particular move when we analyse the candle structure(s).
![[Pasted image 20230827074449.png|500]]

The body is where there is most interest while the wicks represent where the price attempted to go but failed. 

The longer the candle body, the more intense the buying or selling pressure. Conversely a shorter candle body indicates little price movement and represents consolidation or uncertainty. 

Wicks show the fight between the buyers and the sellers and who win it. 
## Long upper wick Vs. Long lower wick
Candles with long upper wicks and short bodies shows [[#Bull|bulls]] tried to push for a higher price, the sellers took control, and there was just too much supply at this point to push the price up. 

Candles with a long lower wick (tail) shows that [[#Bear|bears]] tried to push the price down but the selling pressure was absorbed and the price managed to go up. 
![[Pasted image 20230827075044.png|500]]
If these candles appear in areas of [[#Support|support]] or [[#Resistance|resistance]] or at the top it bottom of a trend it usually signals a reversal.
![[Pasted image 20230827075131.png|335]]![[Pasted image 20230827075214.png|365]]
### Spinning top and Doji
Spinning top has a long top and bottom wicks and a narrow body. A Doji is where the price opened and closed at almost the same price. 
![[Pasted image 20230827075448.png|400]]
These two are generally considered to imply indecision in the market and means a trend might potentially reverse. 
![[Pasted image 20230827075812.png|400]]
### Bullish engulfing Vs. Bearish engulfing
Engulfing candles are the most important candles to show a trend or simply the strength of the move down or up. The smaller the wicks the higher buying pressure there is thought to be. 
![[Pasted image 20230827080042.png|650x200]]

## Conclusion 
1. Long candle body: more intense buying or selling pressure.
2. Short candle body: consolidation.
3. Long bottom wick: sellers trying to push the price down but not
succeeding. 
4. Long top wick: buyers trying to push the price up but not succeeding

# Understanding Market Dynamics
It is the level of desperation or urgency among market participants to enter or exit positions that truly influence market behaviour. 

It helps to view market movements as traders decisions rather than simply observing. The most lucrative profit opportunities often arise when traders find themselves trapped in unfavourable positions and attempt to boil out. Identifying these trapped traders can provide valuable insights into potential market reversals or major price movements. 
## Example
Imagine there was one car with one seller with multiple people wanting a car (buyers). The price for the car naturally increases. however a crucial point is when one of the buyers questions whether they are willing to pay the inflated price for the car. The hesitation initiates a range-bound price movement as buyers reassess their willingness to meet the higher prices. 
Now Imagine there are two more more sellers. buyers will naturally hold back and sellers will need to lower heir prices to attract potential buyers.

# Risk Management
Risk in trading refers to the possibility of incurring financial losses due to adverse market movements. fluctuations in the market can result in significant losses for traders. 90% of traders lose money due to lack of rusk management. 
## Invalidation
As a trader, the market is the first and foremost authority. Knowing when your wrong or your trade invalidation point is the most important piece of information. 
![[Pasted image 20230827082024.png|500]]

Why is invalidation important? 
1. **Risk Management:** Invalidation is a cornerstone of effective risk management. By defining and invalidation point, you're essentially setting a [[#Stop Loss|stop-loss]] level for your trade. If the market hits this level it means your initial analysis was wrong. 
2. **Emotional Control:** Trading is emotional. By setting an invalidation point, you're making a premeditated decision about when you **WILL** exit the market. this reduces emotions like fear & greed.
3. **Account Preservation:** Regularly hitting your invalidation point without managing risk can lead to significant losses over time.  By respecting your invalidation point and exiting trades when necessary, you can preserve your account and live to  trade another day. 
The Different types of invalidation
- **WHEN**
- **WHERE**
- **HOW**
If BTC goes down to 20k before reaching 30k than our long trade idea was wrong. It might not be as simple as **How** and **When** the price reaches that 20k mark, it also plays a part as your trading plans get more sophisticated. 
1. **Where:** There is a when a specific price level that you expected to act as support or resistance doesn't hold. e.g. if you thought $50 would be the support for an asset but it drops to $49, your idea has been invalidated.![[Pasted image 20230827083302.png|700]] *If the price goes below the blue level, the trade idea is no longer valid*
2. **When:**  Here, the invalidation is tied to a specific timeframe. e.g. if you expected an asset top pump after a specific announcement (or something) and it doesn't than your idea is invalidated. ![[Pasted image 20230827083538.png|200]]
3. **Combination of Where and When:** This is when you expect the price to reach a certain point within a specific time frame, but it doesn't move as expected. ![[Pasted image 20230827083712.png|700x250]]
4. **When and How:** This Occurs when the price movement is less than expected within a certain time frame e.g. you expected a price to move by 5% but it only moves 2%. Shows weakness in your idea.

<u style="font-weight:bold">NOTE:</u> Trade ideas can get invalidated even when you are in profit! Idea's can be proved wrong even in profit, so the best path forward in such scenario is to close the trade in profit and move on to the next one.

## The importance of Risk Management
Risk management is essential for every trading strategy or approach, as a trader cannot achieve profitability if they suffer significant loses from a few unfavourable trades. **Safeguarding capital is crucial**. It guarantees your survival and enables you to recover from challenging periods. 

It is important not to invest all your money into your trading account. Your trading account should be substantial enough that it would have significant impact, yet not so substantial that it leads to financial ruin.

Capital loss is an exponential process meaning the more you lose the % required to get back to breakeven exponentially grows as your loss of capital grows 

| Loss of Capital | Percentage required to get back to break even |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 10%             | 11%                                           |
| 20%             | 25%                                           |
| 30%             | 43%                                           |
| 40%             | 67%                                           |
| 50%             | 100%                                          |
| 60%             | 150%                                          |
| 70%             | 233%                                          |
| 80%             | 400%                                          |
| 90%             | 900%                                          |
