# Introduction

## The Study of Charts
studying charts can be done logically, it provides you statistics about the price. Price is derived automatically by the market after considering all the fundamental news, fear & optimism of the market, so the study of charts is the study of trend & strength of the assets.

**The only reason trading with charts works is because historical events replicate themselves and rhyme.** *Patterns that worked well in the past are assumed to continue to work well in the future, 'The study of human psychology which tends not to change'* **Patterns repeat, behaviour repeats**

e.g. If there is a lot of market selling in the support range and it is all being absorbed by the limit orders than we can assume that whales are accumulating there. 

All trading is taking historical data (be it candlesticks patters on a chart or a repeat of similar kind of macroeconomic conditions or new fundamentals or a trend shown pricing). Trading is taking historical data and trying to find correlations where history might rhyme with present conditions. 

This is an introduction tutorial to how markets move and function and how at first you should manage risk and take trades. 

There are two types of trading:
### [[Discretionary Trading]]
Discretionary trading relies on the traders judgement for making all trading decisions. They ultimately make their decisions based on their experience, analysis, intuition & judgement on the market. 
	**For Example:** a discretionary trader might come in at the start of the day with a plan to trade a particular stock if it drops to a certain price. However, if news comes out during the day that changes the trader's outlook on the stock, they might decide not to buy it after all, or perhaps buy more of it than originally planned. 
### [[Systematic Trading]]
Systematic trading refers to a method where decisions are made based on a pre-set system or algorithm. This is developed using quantitative research and statistical analysis. Once a system is developed trades are executed automatically. based on rules set for the system.
	**For Example:** A trading system might be to buy a particular stock when its 50-day moving average crosses above its 200-day moving average, and sell when the opposite happens.
