Anonymous Blocks are apex that is not stored/saved but can be ran to quickly evaluate apex on the fly. This can be done in the Developer console and in VS Code (with extensions).

You could use an anonymous block to test code such as for when you're writing a Web application that takes in input from a user. you could write an anonymous block of apex to insert a contact with the input required such as Name & Address.
