Apex enables you to insert, update, delete or restore data in the database through using DML operations either one record at a time or in bulk.
performing bulk operations on multiple [[sObjects]] as appose to multiple single records is the recommended way to avoid hitting governor limits, such as the 150 statements per Apex transaction.
