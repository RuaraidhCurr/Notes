As in java, you can create classes in apex. A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. An `Object` is an instance of a class. 

For example, the `PurchaseOrder` class describes an entire purchase order, and everything that you can do with a purchase order. An instance of the `PurchaseOrder` class is a specific purchase order that you send or receive.
