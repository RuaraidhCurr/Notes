Apex is a programming language that uses Java-like syntax and acts like a database stored procedures. Apex enables developers to add business logic to system events, such as button click, updates of related records, and Visualforce pages

As a language, Apex is:
- Hosted - Apex is saved, compiled, and hosted on the server - the Lighting Platform
- Object orientated - Apex supports classes, interfaces, and inheritance
- Strongly typed - Apex validates references to objects at compile time
- Multitenant aware - The Lightning Platform guards against runaway code by enforcing limits, which prevent code from monopolizing shared resources
- Integrated with the database - Apex provides direct access
