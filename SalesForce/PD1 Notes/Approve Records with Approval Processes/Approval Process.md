An approval process automates how Salesforce records are approved in your org. To do so you specify:
- The steps necessary for a record to be approved and who approves it at each step.
- The actions to take based on what happens during the approval process

When a user first requests approval for a new position, initial submission actions occur. The default submission actin locks the record. This action ensures that other users cannot change the record while it's being approved. 

Approval steps assign approval requests to various users and define the chain of approval for particular approval processes.
