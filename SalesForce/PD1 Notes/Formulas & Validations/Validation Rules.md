Validation rules verify that data entered by users in records meets the standards you specify before they can save it. 

You can create Validation rules for [[SObjects & Objects|objects]], fields, campaign members, or case milestones. 

A validation rule can contain a formula or expression that evaluates the data in one or more fields and returns a value of “`True`” or “`False`” which if `True` displays an error message to the user trying to create/modify a record.
